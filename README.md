# LandingPage
jameslandy.me code

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>A Landing Page. An experiment. An exercise in CSS Transitions and Javascript.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Sometimes you need a cool landing page. Sometimes you just wanna experiment. Sometimes you do both at the same time.
That is what this is. I used this to make a more inviting landing page than thelostsolstice.com.</p>

<h4>What is the current design?</h4>
<p>The design is currently Metro style. Works well for apps and websites with lots of information to display.</p>

<h4>Can I fork it?</h4>
<p>Sure if you want to. May be a good way to look at how I did the CSS Transitions.</p>
